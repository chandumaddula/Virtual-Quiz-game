# Virtual-Quiz-game
OpenCV-based project, built using Python and Computer Vision

The system detects hand movements in real time and registers selections using a pinch gesture, creating a touch-free and interactive experience.

🔹 Basic Working:
1.Live webcam feed captured using OpenCV
2.Hand landmarks detected using MediaPipe / cvzone
3.MCQ questions loaded dynamically from a CSV file
4.Gesture-based option selection
5.Automatic score calculation with visual progress display

✨ Key Features:
1.Real-time hand gesture interaction
2.Dynamic and scalable MCQ system
3.Clean OpenCV-based UI
4.Live progress bar and result screen
5.Object-oriented Python implementation

📌 Possible Applications:
1.Online exams and assessments
2.Smart classrooms and e-learning platforms
3.Touch-free public interaction systems
4.Interactive learning tools for students
5.AI-based training and evaluation systems

🧠 This project helped me strengthen my understanding of:
1.Computer Vision fundamentals
2.Hand tracking and gesture recognition
3.Real-time UI logic with OpenCV
4.Python OOP and data handling
